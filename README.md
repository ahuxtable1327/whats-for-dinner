# What's for Dinner?

## Overview

What's for dinner? The ultimate question. The goal for this project was to allow studetns to utilize skills learned in the first three weeks of Turing to build out a web page. Combining knowledge of HTML and CSS, we were asked to match a given comp to create the app. JavaScript was then utilized to provide functionality to the page and to create a user experience that allows consumers to find a recipe with the click of a button! This project included technical goals of writing semantic HTML, utilizing event listeners and handliers to respond to user input, and testing DOM manipulation.
